===============================================================================
FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can turn features on and off by clicking the "BugzillaJS Preferences" link
at the top and bottom of every page.  You need to refresh the page to see them
come into effect.

PREFERENCES

  You can turn all features on and off in the preferences (the "BugzillaJS
  Preferences" link at the top and bottom of every page).

SHOW CHANGES

  This will show the changes to the bug inline.  Things like status,
  assigned_to, cc, etc are shown (and, if applicable, attached to the relevant
  comment).

  [Inspired by Bugzilla Tweaks; thanks to potch for the idea/help]

GIT LOGS INLINE

  If a link to a github commit is posted, the changes will be shown inline.

IMAGE GALLERY

  If a link to an image is posted, there will be a gallery inline

LIGHTBOX

  View images as a lightbox, so you don't have to open a new window

ASSIGN TO ME

  Adds an "Assign to Me" button to all bugs not assigned to you.  Based on a
  jetpack by Fred Wenzel.

HIDE EMPTY FIRST COMMENT

  If the first comment is empty, it's not shown.

PRETTY DATES

  Replaces timestamps with relative dates (such as "Last week")

GRAVATARS

  Show an avatar in the comments

GIT STYLE COMMENTS

  Sylizes the comments to look like github comments

REMOVE FLAGS

    Remove the flags field in the bugs (off by default)

REMOVE ACCESSIBILITY KEYS

    Remove the accessibility keys (off by default)

===============================================================================
TODO / KNOWN BUGS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Show attachements inline, too
- Use thumbnails for gallery, not full images with a width+height
- Clean up the code
- Optomize the code so it runs faster

===============================================================================
CONTRIBUTE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have an idea for an extra feature, either ask me to implement it or
you can implement it yourself and submit a patch.  I'll do a better job in the
future of cleaning up the code and possibly making it API-like.


===============================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - You need Greasemonkey on 3.6, and Scriptish for Firefox 4.
 - It conflicts with other Bugzilla Jetpacks and Userscripts, including the
   Bugzilla Tweaks Jetpack running.

IF THERE IS A CONFLICT WITH ANOTHER SCRIPT:
  Simply disabling the feature in the Bugzilla Preferences should fix it.
