BUGZILLA JS
===============================================================================
HOW TO USE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can install the userscript at the following URL:

http://people.mozilla.com/~gkoberger/bugzillajs/bugzillajs.user.js

Note: You must have Greasemonkey installed

A good bug view to explore all the features is:

===============================================================================
FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can turn features on and off by clicking the "BugzillaJS Preferences" link
at the top and bottom of every page.  You need to refresh the page to see them
come into effect.

SHOW CHANGES

  This will show the changes to the bug inline.  Things like status,
  assigned_to, cc, etc are shown (and, if applicable, attached to the relevant
  comment).

  [Inspired by Bugzilla Tweaks; thanks to potch for the idea/help]

  If a link to a github commit is posted, the changes will be shown inline.

===============================================================================
TODO / KNOWN BUGS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Make github work with deletions
- Add dates to "changes"
- Show attachements inline, too
- Use thumbnails for gallery, not full images with a width+height
- Have image galleries link to a lightbox
- Fix pretty dates so it doesn't use DateJS
- Clean up styling when github styles aren't used
- Clean up the code
- Optomize the code so it runs faster

===============================================================================
CONTRIBUTE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have an idea for an extra feature, either ask me to implement it or
you can implement it yourself and submit a patch.  I'll do a better job in the
future of cleaning up the code and possibly making it API-like.


===============================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If it's not working:
 - It's only been tested on FF3.6
 - It won't work if you have the Bugzilla Tweaks Jetpack running
